## SkyRoute is a routing tool that uses breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Python dictionaries to help commuters to get from one landmark to another. We assume that it takes the same time to get from one station to another. The program is for vancouver commuters.

# I used the following files:
 ## graph_search.py - has the bfs() and dfs() functions implemented in python.

 ## vc_landmarks.py-  contains a dictionary of Vancouver landmarks mapped to their nearest metro stations

 ## landmark_choices.py  - contains a dictionary of letters of the alphabet mapped to landmarks to make it easier for users to make a selection

 ## vc_metro.py contains a graph of all stations in the Vancouver metro system
